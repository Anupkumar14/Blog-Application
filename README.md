# Blog-Application
- Built a blog application using REACT.JS and REST API(for fetching users and posts data).
- Implemented the basic blog features like login and register users.
- Allows users to add, edit, delete posts and save images on the server.
- Handled authentication securely using JSON Web Tokens(JWT) and used MongoDB as a database with Node.js and Express powering the backend.
